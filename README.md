Purpose:
-----------
The Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative (WLCI) is a long-term science-based effort to assess and enhance aquatic and terrestrial habitats at a landscape scale in southwest Wyoming, while facilitating responsible development through local collaboration and partnerships.  This repository documents exploratory efforts that help us understand how the extensive amount of information in this regional initiative can be leveraged to help inform other regional and national conservation efforts and how other national biogeographic efforts can be leveraged to help support future WLCI efforts.

Additional Details:
-----------
Currently included exploratory efforts are listed below.  Additional descriptions are documented within the code:
	- Understanding how regional game corridors may be able help inform the Protected Areas Dataset of the United States (PAD-US)
	- Understanding how PAD-US can help inform corridor prioritization efforts
